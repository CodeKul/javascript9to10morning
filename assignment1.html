John and a friend invented a simple game where the player with the highest value of its height (in centimeters) plus five times his age wins

1) Create variables for the heights and ages of two friends and assign them some values 
2) Calculate there scores 
3) Decide who wins and print the winner to the console. Include the score in the string that you output to the console. Don't forgot that there can be the draw (Both players with the same score)4) 

EXTRA: Add a third player and now decide who wins, Hint you will need the && operator to take the decision.
